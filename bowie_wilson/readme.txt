Hello! ^^ You have download a beta version of Bowie Wilson. This version does not include all the features that will be in the final version.

If you have any questions or wanna talk to me you can join the Ukagaka Dream Team Discord Server! My username is [[kai !!#7803]] and I also tend to have 'working on: Bowie' in my nickname. Come join us!

About Bowie:
Bowie is an original character of mine. His story isn't exactly fleshed out yet since I have chosen more to focus on the characters themselves.
Other characters he talks about include: Martin (His boyfriend), Astro, Darren and Tiana. If you would like to see more art of them then you can go to my toyhouse page, which you can find if you press right click on Bowie > Dev's Socials > ToyHouse (CW: There is some suggestive art on there, and it's mostly abandoned so information there is outdated.)

I really hope you enjoy my ghost!

~ Kai â˜…
